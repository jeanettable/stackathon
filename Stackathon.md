# THE _paper

## application to simulate "the official list" used for the performing arts hiring processes. 

 **Inspired by the issues I lived and saw in the audition world for performing artists in NY (and likely elsewhere)

### For Production Teams, this application aims to:

- provide production teams a means of accessing an 'official list' of auditionees
- check-in and management system to work their way through said list
- ability to access individual profiles/hiring materials. 

### For Work-Seekers, this application aims to: 

- provide the artists seeking work the ability to keep a profile and materials in digital form
- sign up for audition events during a window specified by the production teams, entirely online

### Other notable inspo and goals this application aims to cover: 

- eliminating paper waste of mass headshot-resume dumps
- allowing artists in the community and industry to contribute to reforestation efforts through subscription/use
- removing significant cost burden from the artists seeking work who pay out of pocket to print the hiring materials  
- makes job seeking process simplified for and accessible to those who work during hours that “official signups” usually occur
- this idea seeks to be adopted by production teams as a tool to create official audition lists for greater equity as well as to 
- synchronize how teams view hiring materials/profiles of candidates in the audition room virtually (during and after auditions)
